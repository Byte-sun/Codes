What I added & why it matters (short explanation)

1.Correlation heatmap (numeric features) — helps spot multicollinearity and relationships (e.g., medication_count correlating with hospital_days). This informs feature selection and clinical interpretation.

2.Crosstab (single and pairwise) + heatmaps — shows readmission percentages broken down by category (age band × admission type, age band × discharge type, etc.). This identifies high-risk groups (e.g., elderly + emergency admissions), which are directly actionable for targeted interventions.

3.Model coefficient plot (feature importance) — reveals which features increase/decrease readmission odds (e.g., discharge type home_without_service may increase odds). These are the variables hospital managers should act on.

4.ROC curve & confusion matrix — evaluate overall model discrimination and type of errors (false positives vs false negatives). For interventions you usually prefer high recall (catch true high-risk patients), so these metrics guide thresholds.

5.Predicted-probability vs numeric-feature plots — visualize how readmission risk changes with continuous variables (e.g., hospital days, meds). Helpful to decide policy thresholds (e.g., follow-up if med count > X).

6.Saving crosstabs to Excel (crosstabs.xlsx) and images to an OUTPUT_DIR — makes it easy to copy figures into your 15-page report.


          ******Which Graph is best?******

> “What factors contribute most to hospital readmission — and how can we reduce it?”

then you want **graphs that clearly show patterns, risk factors, and actionable trends**.

Let’s go over **the most effective plots** (both **EDA** and **Insight-focused**) for **reducing readmission rates** 👇

---

## 🎯 **Goal-Oriented Visualization Plan**

### 📍 Main Question:

> *Which factors (age, admission type, length of stay, medication count, etc.) are associated with higher readmission, and how can hospitals act on them?*

---

## 🧩 1. **Readmission Rate by Age Group**

**Plot:** Stacked Bar Chart or Line Plot
**Why:** Older age bands often have higher readmission; hospitals can focus follow-up care on these groups.

```python
sns.crosstab(df['V5'], df['V50'], normalize='index').plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, colormap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Readmission Rate by Age Band")
plt.ylabel("Proportion (%)")
plt.xlabel("Age Band")
```

🔍 **Insight:** Identify which age groups have the highest proportion of `<30` or `>30` readmissions.

---

## 🏥 2. **Admission Type vs Readmission**

**Plot:** Grouped Bar Chart
**Why:** Some admission types (like emergency or urgent) are more likely to result in readmission.

```python
sns.countplot(data=df, x="V7", hue="V50", palette="Set2")
plt.title("Admission Type vs Readmission")
plt.xlabel("Admission Type Code")
plt.ylabel("Number of Patients")
```

🔍 **Insight:** High readmission rates for emergency admissions indicate need for better discharge planning.

---

## 🏠 3. **Discharge Type vs Readmission**

**Plot:** Bar Chart
**Why:** Certain discharge types (e.g., “home without care” vs. “home with service”) can show post-care gaps.

```python
sns.countplot(data=df, x="V8", hue="V50", palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Discharge Type vs Readmission")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
```

🔍 **Insight:** Patients discharged “to home” without follow-up services might be key targets for intervention.

---

## 💊 4. **Medication Count vs Readmission**

**Plot:** Boxplot or Violin Plot
**Why:** Too few or too many medications might correlate with instability or poor adherence.

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="V50", y="V15", palette="viridis")
plt.title("Medication Count vs Readmission")
plt.xlabel("Readmission Status")
plt.ylabel("Number of Medications")
```

🔍 **Insight:** Patients with high medication counts may need pharmacy-led reviews or adherence monitoring.

---

## 🧪 5. **Lab Tests / Procedures vs Readmission**

**Plot:** Scatter or Density Plot
**Why:** Excessive or too few lab tests may indicate instability or under-monitoring.

```python
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="V13", y="V14", hue="V50", alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Lab Tests vs Procedures by Readmission Status")
plt.xlabel("Number of Lab Tests")
plt.ylabel("Number of Procedures")
```

---

## ⏱ 6. **Length of Stay (Hospital Days) vs Readmission**

**Plot:** Boxplot
**Why:** Both short and long hospital stays can affect readmission — either premature discharge or severe illness.

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="V50", y="V10", palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Hospital Stay Duration vs Readmission")
```

🔍 **Insight:** Identify if shorter discharges (< average days) lead to higher 30-day readmissions.

---

## 🧬 7. **Top Predictors from Model (Feature Importance Plot)**

**Plot:** Horizontal Bar Chart
**Why:** Shows which variables most influence readmission risk — actionable for hospital management.

After fitting your logistic model:

```python
coef_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': final_feature_names,
    'coef': pipeline.named_steps['clf'].coef_[0]
}).assign(abscoef=lambda x: x.coef.abs()).sort_values('abscoef', ascending=False)

coef_df.head(15).plot(kind='barh', x='feature', y='coef', color='royalblue')
plt.title("Top 15 Predictors of Readmission (Feature Importance)")
plt.xlabel("Model Coefficient")
plt.ylabel("Feature")
```

🔍 **Insight:** Focus policies on features with large positive coefficients (higher readmission odds).

---

## 📊 8. **Crosstab Heatmap (for comparison of two categories)**

**Plot:** Heatmap of readmission % across two categorical factors
**Example:** Age Band × Admission Type

```python
ct = pd.crosstab(df['V5'], df['V7'], values=df['V50'], aggfunc=lambda x: (x==1).mean())
sns.heatmap(ct, cmap="Reds", annot=True, fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Readmission Rate by Age and Admission Type")
```

🔍 **Insight:** See combined risk — e.g., older patients with emergency admissions.
